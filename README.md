# Discovery page challenge

## Description

This page renders restaurants, grouped into 3 categories: Popular, New, and Nearby restaurants. Each category is presented in a way of an infinite horizontal carousel that can be scrolled in both directions with a maximum of 4 items in a row. Every restaurant has a title, a status (online/offline), and a blurhash, which was used instead of an image: [react-blurhash](https://github.com/woltapp/react-blurhash) components were used for this purpose.
